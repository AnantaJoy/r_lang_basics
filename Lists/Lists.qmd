**Lists:** collections of data of different data types. Lists are used to store multiple values in a single variable. Lists are created using the list() function. Lists are mutable, which means they can be modified after they are created.

```{r}
names <- c('A', 'B', 'C', 'D','E','F','G','H');
ages <- c(43,21,23,45,67,76,54,43);
weights <- c(76,56,78,76,56,78,66, 75);

users_info <- rbind(names, ages, weights)
users_list <- list(names, users_info)
str(users_info)
users_list


```

```{r}
users_list[[2]][10:12]
```
